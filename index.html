<P>Hip-hop feuds have been a staple of the culture for decades. Two of the most explosive rivalries are Tupac vs. Notorious B.I.G. in the 90s and today's Drake vs. Kendrick Lamar.
</P>
<p>According to Hip Hop Evolution, sparked by what appears to be a misunderstanding in 1994 when Tupac was shot multiple times and robbed at Quad Studios in New York where Notorious B.I.G happened to be recording, the Tupac vs Biggie beef quickly escalated into a full on hip-hop war between the East and West coast. 
</p>
<p>Tupac claimed that Notorious B.I.G and his producer, Puff Daddy (Diddy), had some knowledge of the shooting, but the New York duo denied any involvement. 
</p>
<p>Shortly after the shooting, Tupac was sentence to jail in a sexual assault case and just days after his incarceration Notorious B.I.G released “Who Shot Ya.” 
</p>
<p>Although the track was recorded before Tupac was shot, the timing of the release only inflamed allegations that Biggie was involved in Tupac’s shooting. 
</p>
<p>Clear lines were drawn in sand as the bicoastal beef reached a boil. 
</p>
<p>Shortly after being released from prison Tupac released the explosive diss record “Hit em Up.” In the song Tupac declared, “Fuck Mobb Deep, fuck Biggie Fuck Bad Boy as a staff, record label and as a motherfuckin' crew And if you want to be down with Bad Bod, then fuck you too.”
</p>
<p>The coasts were on fire. 
</p>
<p>“It was crazy. It was all anyone could ever talk about and everyone was choosing sides,” said Annabeth Deamer-White, a lifelong hip-hop enthusiast. 
</p>
<p>This legendary beef ended tragically when Tupac was shot and killed in Las Vegas on September 7th 1996. Not long after, Notorious B.I.G was murdered in Los Angeles on March 9, 1997.

</p>
<p>The Tupac vs Notorious B.I.G rivalry electrified the hip-hop community, much like the recent Kendrick Lamar vs Drake beef. 
</p>
<p>Their tension began after Lamar's feature on Big Sean's "Control" in 2013, where he called out Drake and other rappers. 
</p>
<p>Drake didn’t take too kindly to that and the two have been subliminally dissing each other since. </p>
<p>However, things started heating up when J.Cole alleged that himself, Lamar, and Drake were the big three in hip hop on a feature on Drake’s “First Person Shooter” in 2023. 
</p>

<p>Kendrick Lamar responded by saying,
    <!-- This is the actual audio embed with your mp3 file -->
    <span class="soundcite" data-url="likethat.mp3" data-plays="1">“Motherf–k” the big three, 
        n—a, it’s just big me” on Future and Metro Boomin’s track “Like That.” </span>

<p>In retaliation, on April 19, 2024 Drake dropped "Push Ups." The diss mocked Lamar for his short height as well as criticized other artists in the game like The Weeknd and Future. 
</p>
<p>Without giving much time for Kendrick to respond, Drake dropped second diss, “Taylor Made Freestyle,” on his Instagram. According to Billboard, the rapper used the AI generated voices of Tupac and Snoop Dogg to express his disappointment in Lamar. 
</p>
<p>Just a few days later Kendrick Lamar released “Euphoria.” The diss criticized Drake for using the N-word, accused the Canadian rapper of using ghost writers and more. Lamar was not shy about his feelings, rapping tempo “I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress, I hate the way that you sneak diss, if I catch flight, it's gon' be direct.”
</p>
<p>Less than 72 hours after “Euphoria,” Lamar dropped a second diss “6:16 in LA” in which he speculated that there was a mole in Drake’s OVO crew and accused Drake’s friends of stabbing the Canadian rapper in the back. 
</p>
<p>Only 14 hours after Lamar’s “6:16 in LA," Drake dropped “Family Matters” where he accused Lamar of abusing his fiance Whitney Alford, criticizing the rapper for acting like a “Black Messiah,” but being in a relationship with a mixed woman, and more. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, Drake explosively speculated that one of Lamar's children belongs to Dave Free - Lamar’s long-time friend and the former president of Top Dawg Records- according to HotNewHipHop.
</p>
<p>Quite literally minutes after Drake’s “Family Matters,” Lamar dropped the haunting track "Meet The Grahams.” 
</p>
<p>The rapper began by addressing Drake’s son: “Dear Adonis, I'm sorry that that man is your father, let me be honest,” and he continued to dedicate each verse to addressing members of Drake's family.
</p>
<p>While addressing Drake’s mother Sandra, Lamar made his opinion of the rapper clear, “Your son's a sick man with sick thoughts, I think niggas like him should die.” 
</p>
<p>Lamar also accused the rapper of having a daughter he’s kept hidden - adding to Drake’s history of hiding his kids. The rapper’s son Adonis’ existence was only uncovered during Drake’s feud with rapper Pusha-T in the early 2010s.
</p>
<p>Less than 24 hours after “Meet The Grahams,” Lamar dropped the “Not Like Us” on May 4th, 2024, the “killing blow,” according to Cabral Carter - a 20 year old hip-hop enthusiast. 
</p>
<p>On top of a West Coast style beat, Lamar repeatedly accuses Drake of being a pedophile: “Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A minor.”
</p>
<p>Drake addressed the allegations the following day on a track called “The Heart Pt.6” where he claimed to have baited the Compton rapper with false information. 
</p>
<p>Though some members of the hip hop community were divided about who “won” the beef, for many the clear winner was Kendrick Lamar. According to Carter the Canadian rapper was “out played, outsmarted, outwitted, and outwritten.”

   <p class ="cutline">Data from Spotify as of March 6th, 2025</p>
<p>Since the heated exchange between Lamar and Drake, Lamar’s Not Like Us, has soared in popularity, passing over 1 billion streams on Spotify and winning Lamar 5 Grammys at the 2025 award show. 
</p>

<p>If there were a diss record hall of fame, it is safe to say that Tupac’s Hit Em Up, which remains a hit record and one of the artist’s top streamed songs,  and Kendirck’s Not Like Us would certainly be in it.</p>
